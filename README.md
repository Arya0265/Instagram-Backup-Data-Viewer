# Instagram-Backup-Data-Viewer
To view the download backup data(message) of instagram

To make a backup of instagram chat is very difficult task for people. Some use screenshots, some will record screen with scrolling chat message or some some lost all the hopes. But there is a simple way to download all your instagram account information including chat messages. For More information just visit [here!](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920). But the problem with this downloaded data is files are in json format which is not user friendly to read for normal user. So to view all your messages in user friendly way I have create a script which will load and show your backup messages in a UI like instagram. 

## Steps to use
* First Extract the .zip file that you have download from instagram
* Copy all the file of these repository and paste it into your extracted folder
* Open index.html file in your mozilla firefox browser and enjoy :sunglasses:.

Note : This will work only in firefox browser because it supports Cross origin requests.
